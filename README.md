 Python Spotify Track Service

## About 
You can search by genre and artist name by accessing the Spotify service on the web platform.
Written with the 'Flask' library using the Python v3.9 programming language.
Interfaces are made with HTML, CSS and JS.

The program provides access to songs, albums and many more as a result of the verification made by connecting to the spotify API.

## Setup
In order to run the program, a python environment must be prepared.
The Flask package must be installed on the created python environment. (pip install flask) After installing the flask package, "set FLASK_APP=track" command should be run in the command interface.
With the command run, we now introduce our code to the system.
The "flask run" command should be used to boot the entire system. The program will start running on the local server of the computer. You can go to the address "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" by clicking the link or using the default browsers on the computer.
You can search by song type and singer name via the radio buttons on the page that opens. After the search, you will see the details of the songs and many other things on the page that is directed. (http://127.0.0.1:5000/tracks/rock etc.) To make other searches, you need to return to the previous page, namely the main page.
